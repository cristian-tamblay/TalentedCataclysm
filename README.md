# TalentedCataclysm
WoW addon. A replacement to the default talent UI that allows creation of templates and viewing of all trees at once.

This was an addon originally written by "Jerry" (URL: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12593-Talented.html). The project is since abandoned, so I adapted old code to form this version.

- Removed export/import functionalities
